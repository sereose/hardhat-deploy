1. Send eth to the contract on private chain because they will be doing the unlock transaction ...
2. Send eth to the contract on public chain because they will be doing stuff
3. some prechecks before continuing the transaction like balance etc
4. increase block range so even if we restart, the block can be synced quickly .... think this thru once more,
    since we have only two contracts, we dont need to do much, we can start the listeners and it keeps syncing
